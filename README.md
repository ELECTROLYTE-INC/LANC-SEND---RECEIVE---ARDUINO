# LANC-SEND---RECEIVE---ARDUINO
A simple code with no libraries to Send  AND receive LANC command in the same time ! 

LOT OF THANKS TO KOCH Martin, ROCHOLL Ariel and... GPT Chat !

2 days on this freaking code ! Just some error like the forgotten nCommandTimes = 0; ligne 221 to reset the Command Time ! 

I Will add in few day all the LANC code from Martin and Me  !

Example : (From http://www.boehmel.de/lanc#byte2)
